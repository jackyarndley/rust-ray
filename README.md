# rust-ray
Rust implementation of a simple ray tracer based off 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend'. Only spheres are supported to be rendered, and there are 3 different materials; dielectric, metallic and translucent. Each of these is implemented in rust as a material and the current interface can be easily extended to allow for a wider variety of materials.
